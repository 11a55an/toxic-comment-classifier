# Toxic Comment Classifier

This repository contains a machine learning model to classify toxic comments using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Overview

The Toxic Comment Classifier is designed to classify comments into various categories such as toxic, non-toxic, hate speech, offensive language, etc. It can be used to identify harmful comments in online platforms and social media.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, etc.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using labeled comment data.
- **Classification**: Classify comments into predefined categories.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries**: NLTK
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: KNN, Logistic Regression, Bernoulli NB, Multinomial NB, SVM and Random Forest.
- **Web Development (Optional)**: Flask or Django for creating a web interface.
